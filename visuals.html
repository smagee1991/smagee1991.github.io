		<h2>Rego</h2>
		<img src="images/Rego_.jpg">	
		<p>Rego is an app I found that keeps track of the places you have been and is an easy trip planer. It also lets you share
your favorite places with your friends and allows you to give recommendations. I saw they used a lot of maps 
which immediatly cought my attention because thats a feature I&rsquo;m using Im my app. It was really helpful for me
to see the way another app laid things out. This app is also very simple and easy too use which is something you
have to keep in mind when designing your app. Comparing it to my app I think mine has more features and while they 
both pretain to different things they still both have a location feature, a sharing with friends feature and a favorites 
freature. I will definatly take some ideas from Rego. </p>
